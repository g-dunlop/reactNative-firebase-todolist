# reactNative-firebase-todolist
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is a project I've recently been working on.  Although the todo list is a well-trodden path, the project allowed me to have a go with and start learning a lot of tools I haven't used before.</p>

<h2>Tools</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Figma design tools (see <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/VtdIdSTRVnJesQ4OQZmyf2/ToDoList?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">here</a> for the basic wireframe and prototype used.)</li>
  <li>React-Native, React Navigation & Expo for mobile development</li>
  <li>Firebase Auth & Firestore Database</li>
 </ul>
 
<h2>Project Brief</h2>

<h4>MVP</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>A user should be able to:
    <ul>
      <li>Sign up, be verified over email, login to the app and reset password via email if needed.</li>
      <li>Create and delete lists.</li>
      <li>Create to do tasks within a list and set these tasks to 'completed' as required.</li>
      <li>Navigate to an account page from a tab navigator and sign out from the app.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <h4>Possible Extensions</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>The user create a shared list and invite others to add to it or set tasks to completed.</li>
  <li>A calendar to add events to.</li>
  <li>A set of timers (pomodoro, alarms).</li>
 </ul>
 </ul>
 
 <h2>How to Run the App</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Fork the repository and then clone it clone to local computer</li>
    <li>npm install</li>
    <li>expo start</li>
    <li>from expo local host in the browser, you can choose how to run the app.  You can scan the QR qith your phone.  Run on an emulator (Android 11 API30) or in the web browser</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What I learned</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>This was mostly a way of learning the different JSX components in React Native.  Much of React Native is the same in terms of passing props, using states etc.  However, I will be looking into Redux next before I start on bigger mobile apps.  It was also my first time using the Android Studio emulator with Expo and my first attempt at using Cloud services.  <li>
    <li>Firebase is a lot more accessible for a junior developer in my opinion than AWS, which can be overwhelming to get started with.  Firebase is a great way to get Auth and a cloud database up and running quickly and the free limits are quite generous!</li>
    <li>I'd heard about Figma so it was great to have a go at it.  Tutorials on how to configure preset fonts and colors as well as how to create components helped me a lot.</li>
    <li>Styling in React Native proved a little tricky, especially when it involved flatlists and scroll views.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What I would do differently</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>I haven't gone to town on the UX of this app as it was mostly a short practice project so there's much that can be improved.  I will come back and add shared lists as soon as possible. </li>
  </ul>
